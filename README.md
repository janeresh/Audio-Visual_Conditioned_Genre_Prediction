# Audio-Visual_Conditioned_Genre_Prediction
This is CS670 Project repository.

In this project, we propose a novel approach to genre classification in video content by integrating audio and visual analysis techniques. Our aim is to develop a system that can accurately classify video clips based on genre. 

Features can be extracted using the file: [final_feature_extract.py](final_feature_extract.py) and [video_feature_extraction.py](video_feature_extraction.py) 

Video Classification models implementation and results: [VideoClassificationModels.py](VideoClassificationModels.py)

Audio Classification models implementation and results: [cnnaudio.py](cnnaudio.py)

Fusion models implementation and results: [fusion_model.py](fusion_model.py)

To demonstrate the model's capabilities, we can execute a demo using [file](CS670_test.ipynb)
